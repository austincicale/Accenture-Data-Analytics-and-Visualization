# Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization

### Project Overview

This project serves as a simulated Data Analytics and Visualization job experience offered through Forage, a platform providing free virtual work experience programs. In this simulation, I assumed the role of an analyst working for Accenture. My task was to assist Social Buzz, a fictional social media company experiencing rapid growth, in implementing best practices for handling large datasets. Specifically, I analyzed their content categories to identify the top 5 categories with the highest aggregate popularity.

### Requirements gathering

### Data cleaning

There were 7 data sets, each containing different columns and values

A data model shows the relationship between all the data sets

Decided to use the following data sets: Reaction, Content, Content Types

The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.
As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type.
We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.

Clean the data by:

removing rows that have values which are missing,
changing the data type of some values within a column, and
removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

### Data modeling

Now we want to figure out the top 5 categories. To complete your data modelling, follow these steps:

1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together

We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
Hint: You can use a “VLookUp” formula
 
2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories

Add up the total scores for each category.
Hint: You can use the “Sum If” formula

The end result should be one spreadsheet which contains:

A cleaned dataset
The top 5 categories
